# Schedule-mobile-app
Mobile application for storing school schedule and managing homework. This project was done within final project exam in my school.

# Homework managing
Supports several main commands:
- Add new lesson
- Delete lesson
- Change subject name
- Add homework or some notes
- Mark homework as completed

# Bells managing

During covid-19 our school bells changed. This led to great confusion of students and teachers. I decided to add bells schedule as a separate tab in my app to check when lessons start.

Functionality
- Add new lesson
- Delete lesson
- Change start/end timing
