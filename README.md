# Schedule-mobile-app
Mobile application for storing school schedule and managing homework. This project was done within final project exam in my school.

This app maintains two main goals:
- Lesson schedule & Homework managing
- Bells schedule 

**Note:** interface is available only in russian.

## Lesson schedule & Homework managing
Supports several main commands:
- Add new lesson
- Delete lesson
- Change subject name
- Add homework or some notes
- Mark homework as completed

## Bells schedule

During the covid-19 pandemic our school bells' schedule had changed. This led to great confusion among students and teachers. I decided to add bells schedule as a separate tab in my app to check when do lessons start.

Functionality
- Add new lesson
- Delete lesson
- Change start/end timing

## How does it look?
